## Getting Started

You can download Tippy binary for your platform of choice from the [releases](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/tippy/releases) page.

Tippy is pre-built as self-contained .Net Core application. You don't have to install .Net Core to run it. If you're running it on Linux or macOS and want to use the Debugger feature, please install debugger dependencies following [this](#install-dependencies) section.

### On Windows:

* Download `tippy-win-x64.zip`
* Extract the zip file (default to `tippy-win-x64`)
* Enter `tippy-win-x64` folder and click `Tippy.exe` to start

### On Linux:

####  1、start with docker
```
docker run -it --rm -v /mnt/f/docker.tippy.user/CKBSTATE:/app/CKBSTATE  -v /mnt/f/docker.tippy.user/scripts:/app/BinDeps/scripts   -p 8000:80  --name tippy registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/nervos/tippy:0.3.3
```

####  2、also you can start with tippy Run files
* Download `tippy-linux-x64.tar.gz`
* Extract the tar.gz file (default to `tippy-linux-x64`)
* Make `Tippy` executable: `chmod +x ./tippy-linux-x64/Tippy`
* `cd tippy-linux-x64` then run `./Tippy` to start

We also provide a Homebrew formula to install with one-liner:

```
brew install nervosnetwork/tap/tippy-linux
```

Then simply run `tippy` to start

### On macOS:

* Download `Tippy.dmg`
* Open the dmg file and drag `Tippy.app` to `/Applications` folder
* From `/Applications` click `Tippy.app` to start

We also provide a Homebrew cask to install with one-liner:

```
brew install nervosnetwork/tap/tippy
```

### Tippy Console and UI

While Tippy runs as a console application, it also provides web UI. By default the dashboard UI will be opened automatically, if not you can access it by visiting [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) from a browser.

### Override the App URL

If you want to access the Web UI and Tippy API from another URL than the default `http://localhost` URL, there are two options.

#### 1. Set Environment Variable `ASPNETCORE_URLS`

On Linux you can set the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` Environment Variable to override the default App URL. For example, launch Tippy this way to use `http://0.0.0.0:5000`:

```shell
ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://0.0.0.0:5000" tippy
```

#### 2. Modify `appsettings.json`

You can also modify `appsettings.json` file to override the default App URL. For example, add the following section to use `http://0.0.0.0:5000`:

```json
"Kestrel": {
  "EndPoints": {
    "Http": {
      "Url": "http://0.0.0.0:5000"
    }
  }
}
```

`appsettings.json` locates in `/Applications/Tippy.app/Contents/MacOS/` on macOS and in the root Tippy folder on Windows/Linux. If Tippy is installed with Homebrew on Linux then it locates in `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/tippy-linux/[version]/libexec/`.

### Debugger

Tippy ships with [CKB Debugger](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-standalone-debugger) to help off-chain contract development.

*Note: debugger is only supported on Linux and macOS. It's unavailable on Windows.*

## Install Dependencies

Debugger requires `ttyd` and `gdb`. We recommend that you install them with homebrew.

For Linux

```bash
brew install ttyd gdb
```

For macOS, build gdb from source (with `--build-from-source` option)

```bash
brew install gdb --HEAD --build-from-source
brew install ttyd
```

## API

Tippy exposes a set of RPCs in JSON-RPC 2.0 protocols for controlling a devchain.

It also proxies API calls to the active running devchain for transparent CKB interactions.

The URL of Tippy RPC is <code>http://localhost:5000/api</code>.

### CKB RPCs

For CKB RPCs, simply call any API method with Tippy API URL. For example:

```
echo '{
  "id": 2,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "get_tip_block_number",
  "params": []
}' \
| tr -d '\n' \
| curl -H 'content-type: application/json' -d @- \
http://localhost:5000/api
```

See [CKB JSON-RPC doc](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/rpc) for more information.

### The `send_transaction` API method

If you call CKB's `send_transaction` API method through Tippy API, the transactions will be recorded in Tippy. Go to the `Recorded Transactions` tab to view them.

```shell
dotnet ef migrations add [MigrationName] --project src/Tippy.Core --startup-project src/Tippy
```

Or open `Package Manager Console` in Visual Studio, select `Tippy.Core` as `Default project`, then run

```shell
Add-Migration [MigrationName]
```

## Design

Tippy's page design is based on [mazipan/bulma-admin-dashboard-template](https://github.com/mazipan/bulma-admin-dashboard-template).

## Q&A

### I'm using Tippy in WSL and I can see the Tippy UI via localhost:5000, but the height is always 0

This is probably because you have proxy enabled. Try launching Tippy with the following command

```
unset HTTPS_PROXY HTTP_PROXY http_proxy https_proxy
path/to/Tippy
```

### Where can I find the CKB node data started with Tippy

- Linux: `~/.config/Tippy`
- Win: `~/ApplicationData/Tippy`
